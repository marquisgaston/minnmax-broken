This is a fun and sometimes painful stroll down memory lane, we also admit where we were completely wrong in retrospect. How does Mass Effect 2 shape up against Super Mario Galaxy 2 in retrospect? Red Dead Redemption 1 vs. 2? We hope you enjoy us reliving every frustrating argument over the last 9 years!

        Just a reminder, we have our first MinnMax community meetup on Monday, December 9th at 8pm at Bauhaus Brew Labs in Minneapolis. You don't have to be a Patreon supporter to swing by. If you're not in Minneapolis, we're raising money to buy toys for kids stuck in the hospital over the holidays right here -  https://www.gofundme.com/f/sweet-toys... `;
